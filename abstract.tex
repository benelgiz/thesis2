The new era of small UAVs necessitates intelligent approaches towards 
the issue of fault diagnosis to ensure a safe flight. A recent attempt to 
accommodate quite a number of UAVs in the airspace requires to assure a safety level.
The hardware limitations for these small vehicles point the utilization of analytical 
redundancy rather than the usual practice of hardware redundancy in the conventional flights.
In the course of this study, fault detection and diagnosis for aircraft is reviewed. 
An approach of implementing machine learning practices to diagnose faults on a small 
fixed-wing is selected. The selection criteria behind is that, data-driven fault diagnosis 
enables avoiding the burden of accurate modeling needed in model-based fault diagnosis.
